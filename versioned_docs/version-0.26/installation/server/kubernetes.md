# Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

This section provides all required dependencies to install and start the server with Kubernetes.

### Dependency 1: Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) will be used for downloading the server and managing the lifecycle of the application.

You can refer to [Kubernetes' official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) on installing and configuring the service.

### Dependency 2: Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) will be used for storing workloads, created by the server, that will run on a [worker](/docs/installation/worker/worker.md).

You can refer to [Redis's official documentation](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart/) on installing and configuring the service.
