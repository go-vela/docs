  YAML keys for stages block
---

The `stages` key is intended to be used to parallelize one-to-many sets of step tasks.

```yaml
---
# This document is displaying all the required keys
# to run two stages with one step task in parallel.
stages:
  hello:
    steps:
      - name: Hello World
        image: alpine:latest
        commands:
          - echo "Hello, Vela User"

  welcome:
    steps:
      - name: Welcome to Vela
        image: alpine:latest
        commands:
          - echo "Welcome to Vela!"
```
