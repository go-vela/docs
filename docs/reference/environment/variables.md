## Service Only Defaults

The following environment variables are **only** injected into every step container.

| Key                         | Value                    | Explanation                                                           |

## Using Substitution For Platform Variables

There are a few default environment variables that need to be [escaped](/reference/environment/substitution/#escaping) when attempting to substitute, as they are not available or not accurate at compile time.

| Key                        | Compile Time  | Build Time Example  |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| `VELA_BUILD_STARTED`       | `0`           | `1556730001`        |
| `VELA_BUILD_STATUS`        | `pending`     | `running`           |
| `VELA_BUILD_APPROVED_AT`   | `0`           | `1556730001`        |
| `VELA_BUILD_APPROVED_BY`   | `''`          | `Octocat`           |
| `VELA_BUILD_ENQUEUED`      | `0`           | `1556730001`        |
| `VELA_BUILD_RUNTIME`       | `''`          | `docker`            |
| `VELA_BUILD_DISTRIBUTION`  | `''`          | `linux`             |
| `VELA_BUILD_HOST`          | `''`          | `vela-worker-42`    |
