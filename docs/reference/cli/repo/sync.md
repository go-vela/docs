## Description

The sync command allows users to re-align their repository in Vela with its SCM mirror. This discrepancy can come in the form of a repository that has been deleted from the SCM but not in Vela. 

Further, as of `v0.19.0`, the sync command can be used to adjust events that are sent to Vela from the SCM that the Vela-instance of the repo is not subscribed to. For example, if your audit page has errors like

```sh
"unable to process webhook: <org>/<repo> does not have comment events enabled"
```

running the sync command should re-configure the SCM webhook to only send events that are allowed. Once aligned, you should not have to run this command again, even if the subscribed events are changed.
