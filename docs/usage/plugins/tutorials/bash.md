:::warning
We recommend reviewing [Docker's best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) before attempting to create a custom plugin.

We recommend that all plugins be placed inside a [scratch image](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch).
:::

## Overview

From [Bash documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/):

> Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
>
> It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

## Code

To create a plugin using Bash, we'll need to first decide what task we want this plugin to accomplish.

For this example, we're going to create a script that runs a `curl` command from the provided input:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# import method parameter from environment
method=${PARAMETER_METHOD}
# import body parameter from environment
body=${PARAMETER_BODY}
# import url parameter from environment
url=${PARAMETER_URL}

# send curl request from provided input
curl \
  -X "${method}" \
  -d "${body}" \
  "${url}"
```

:::tip
An example of this code is provided in the [bash section](https://github.com/go-vela/vela-tutorials/tree/main/plugins/bash) of the [go-vela/vela-tutorials](https://github.com/go-vela/vela-tutorials/tree/main/plugins) repository.
:::

## Image

Once we have the executable needed to accomplish our plugin's task, we need to create a Dockerfile to produce an image.

This image should contain the script and be setup to run that script when the plugin is executed:

```docker
FROM alpine

RUN apk add --update --no-cache bash ca-certificates curl

COPY vela-sample.sh /bin/vela-sample.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["bash", "/bin/vela-sample.sh"]
```

:::tip
An example of this image is provided in the [target/vela-sample](https://hub.docker.com/r/target/vela-sample) Docker repository.
:::

## Publishing

In order to run the plugin in a pipeline, we'll need to make sure we build and publish it to a Docker registry:

```sh
# build the image
docker build -t target/vela-sample:bash .

# publish the image
docker push target/vela-sample:bash
```

:::info
This has the added benefit of enabling others in the community to consume your plugin!
:::

## Troubleshooting

To verify that the plugin performs the desired task, it can be executed locally via the command line:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -e PARAMETER_BODY="This is a sample Vela plugin written with Bash" \
  -e PARAMETER_METHOD="POST" \
  -e PARAMETER_URL="http://vela.localhost.com" \
  target/vela-sample:bash
```

## Usage

After publishing the image to a Docker registry, it can be referenced in a pipeline:

```yaml
version: "1"

steps:
  - name: sample bash plugin
    image: target/vela-sample:bash
    pull: always
    parameters:
      url: http://vela.localhost.com
      method: POST
      body: |
        This is a sample Vela plugin written with Bash
```
