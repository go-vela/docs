Templates help to create reusable workflows in order to make grouping tasks like building and deploying code.

Templates can solve duplicative tasks in a single workflow or be leveraged by any number of pipelines to make reusable tasks across multiple workflows.

In this pipeline each step is shown with the minimum required YAML keys to execute a step.

Both steps are pulling a [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and executing echo statements.
