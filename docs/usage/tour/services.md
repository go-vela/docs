This declaration allows you to provide detached (headless) container for the duration of a pipeline.

Services are always ran, in parallel alongside the ephemeral steps in the pipeline. They are extremely useful when your testing requires additional services such as a cache, database or queue.

Services are always created at the beginning of a pipeline in the order they are defined.

The `name:` field of the service defines what the hostname of the service will for available communicate to other tasks the pipeline.

However, there are times when you need more control over when a service is created. Perhaps you are dealing with a service that has start up dependencies and service A needs something to start up before service B is started.
