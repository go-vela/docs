If you've followed the documentation for [enabling a repo](/docs/usage/enable_repo/) and wrote a pipeline ([here are some example pipelines](/docs/usage/examples/)), all that should be left is to push your pipeline to your repo.

If a build does not trigger when your push a change to your repo, check the webhook response to see if there is an error.
