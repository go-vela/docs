  Example Node Pipeline
---

Example [Yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/) configuration for a project building a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) application.

## Scenario

User is looking to create a pipeline that builds an artifact on any event or branch pushed to source control.

### Steps

The following [pipeline concepts](/docs/tour/) are being used in the pipeline below:

* [Steps](/docs/tour/steps/)
  * [image](/docs/tour/image/)
  * [Pull](/docs/tour/image/)
  * [Commands](/docs/tour/steps/)

:::tip
Pipeline must be stored in base of repository as `.vela.yml` or `.vela.yaml`

It is recommended to pin `image:` versions for production pipelines
:::

```yaml
version: "1"

steps:
  - name: install
    image: node:latest
    pull: always
    commands:
      - node install

  - name: lint
    image: node:latest
    pull: always
    commands:
      - node test

  - name: build
    image: node:latest
    pull: always
    commands:
      - node build
```

### Stages

The following [pipeline concepts](/docs/tour/) are being used in the pipeline below:

* [Stages](/docs/tour/stages/)
  * [Needs](/docs/tour/stages/)
  * [Steps](/docs/tour/steps/)
    * [image](/docs/tour/image/)
    * [Pull](/docs/tour/image/)
    * [Commands](/docs/tour/steps/)
