We're excited to unveil the new home for Vela documentation! Built with Docusaurus, the new docsite brings a host of enhancements to improve your reading experience:

- **Better search**: Search will give you real-time previews of what you're trying to find, and is much more accurate.
- **Smarter sidebars**: Navigate through documentation with ease with sidebars that expand and collapse as needed
- **Consolidated sections**: We've restructured the content to make it easier to find what you need with fewer sections.
- **Versioned documentation**: Starting with v0.25, pages will be tied to specific releases; previous versions can be toggled in the upper right.

Because content has been reorganized, links you had in your internal documentation to this site may need to be updated!

We hope you find the new Vela docsite helpful and easy to use. Happy browsing! ðŸš€

Feel free to explore and let us know your feedback. Your input is invaluable as we continue to improve our documentation.
