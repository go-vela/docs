Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang.

Vela uses a syntax similar to Docker Compose to define its configuration. This structure for repeated use, within the application, is called a pipeline and a single execution of a pipeline is referenced as a build.
